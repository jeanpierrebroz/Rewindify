Basic Premise: Spotify listening history collection + visualization. 

Goals: Make something people want to use, gain personal experience, learn best practices

MVP: something that lets you drag + drop your listening history in and click different options (cumulative listens over time, cumulative artist listens, top k songs, etc). Has appeal by abstracting away a lot of the window function/group by stuff you would have to write manually. can do total minutes, by year, slice and dice data a million different ways. Free to use, no account req'd. Make graphs/charts consumable, shareable

v1: we store your listening history for on-demand visualizations. you can (within 30 minutes of recency) see how your listening habits have changes since joining the platform. you can also import your data to get a full picture. we will need auth for this. Also setting up Stripe.

v2: running statistical tests on your listening trends. comparing aggregated data of other users on the platform to your habits. LLM-generated summaries based on statistical findings.
